ULMFiT was the first **Transfer Learning** method applied to NLP. As a result, besides significantly outperforming many state-of-the-art tasks, it allowed, with only 100 labeled examples, to match performances equivalent to models trained on 100×  more data.\n\nThe first time I heard about ULMFiT was during a [fast.ai course](https://course.fast.ai/videos/?lesson=4) given by Jeremy Howard. He demonstrated how it was easy  -  thanks to the ``fastai`` library  -  to implement the complete ULMFit method with only a few lines of codes. In his demo, he used an AWD-LSTM neural network pre-trained on Wikitext-103 and get rapidly state-of-the-art results. He also explained key techniques - also demonstrated in ULMFiT - to fine-tune the models like **Discriminate Learning Rate**, **Gradual Unfreezing** or **Slanted Triangular Learning Rates**.\n\nSince the introduction of ULMFiT, **Transfer Learning** became very popular in NLP and yet Google (BERT, Transformer-XL, XLNet), Facebook (RoBERTa, XLM) or even OpenAI (GPT, GPT-2) begin to pre-train their own model on very large corpora. This time, instead of using the AWD-LSTM neural network, they all used a more powerful architecture based on the Transformer (cf. [Attention is all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)).\n\nAlthough these models are powerful, ``fastai`` do not integrate all of them. Fortunately, [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/) 🤗 created the well know [transformers library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers). Formerly knew as ``pytorch-transformers`` or ``pytorch-pretrained-bert``, this library brings together over 40 state-of-the-art pre-trained NLP models (BERT, GPT-2, RoBERTa, CTRL…). The implementation gives interesting additional utilities like tokenizer, optimizer or scheduler.\n\nThe ``transformers`` library can be self-sufficient but incorporating it within the ``fastai`` library provides simpler implementation compatible with powerful fastai tools like  **Discriminate Learning Rate**, **Gradual Unfreezing** or **Slanted Triangular Learning Rates**. The point here is to allow anyone — expert or non-expert — to get easily state-of-the-art results and to “make NLP uncool again”.\n\nIt worth noting that the integration of the HuggingFace ``transformers`` library in ``fastai`` has already been demonstrated in:\n* Keita Kurita's article [A Tutorial to Fine-Tuning BERT with Fast AI](https://mlexplained.com/2019/05/13/a-tutorial-to-fine-tuning-bert-with-fast-ai/) which makes ``pytorch_pretrained_bert`` library compatible with ``fastai``.\n* Dev Sharma's article [Using RoBERTa with Fastai for NLP](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/using-roberta-with-fastai-for-nlp-7ed3fed21f6c) which makes ``pytorch_transformers`` library compatible with ``fastai``.\n\nAlthough these articles are of high quality, some part of their demonstration is not anymore compatible with the last version of ``transformers``.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 🛠 Integrating transformers with fastai for multiclass classification\nBefore beginning the implementation, note that integrating ``transformers`` within ``fastai`` can be done in multiple different ways. For that reason, I decided to bring simple solutions, that are the most generic and flexible. More precisely, I try to make the minimum of modification in both libraries while making them compatible with the maximum amount of transformer architectures.\n\nNote that in addition to this NoteBook and the [Medium article](https://medium.com/p/fastai-with-transformers-bert-roberta-xlnet-xlm-distilbert-4f41ee18ecb2?source=email-29c8f5cf1dc4--writer.postDistributed&sk=119c3e5d748b2827af3ea863faae6376), I made another version available on my GitHub(TODO add link).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Libraries Installation\nBefore starting the implementation, you will need to install the ``fastai`` and ``transformers`` libraries.

It aims to make you understand where to look and modify both libraries to make them work together. Likely, it allows you to use **Slanted Triangular Learning Rates**, **Discriminate Learning Rate** and even **Gradual Unfreezing**. As a result, without even tunning the parameters, you can obtain rapidly state-of-the-art results.\n\nThis year, the transformers became an essential tool to NLP. Because of that, I think that pre-trained transformers architectures will be integrated soon to future versions of fastai. Meanwhile, this tutorial is a good starter.\n\nI hope you enjoyed this first article and found it useful. \nThanks for reading and don't hesitate in leaving questions or suggestions.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# References\n* Hugging Face, Transformers GitHub (Nov 2019), [https://github.com/huggingface/transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)\n* Fast.ai, Fastai documentation (Nov 2019), [https://docs.fast.ai/text.html](https://docs.fast.ai/text.html)\n* Jeremy Howard & Sebastian Ruder, Universal Language Model Fine-tuning for Text Classification (May 2018), [https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146)\n* Keita Kurita's article : [A Tutorial to Fine-Tuning BERT with Fast AI](https://mlexplained.com/2019/05/13/a-tutorial-to-fine-tuning-bert-with-fast-ai/) (May 2019)\n* Dev Sharma's article : [Using RoBERTa with Fastai for NLP](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/using-roberta-with-fastai-for-nlp-7ed3fed21f6c) (Sep 2019)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
